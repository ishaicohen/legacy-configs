# stats.lua

ETLegacy server-side Lua stats module. Collects per-round weapon stats, objective tracking,
movement/stance metrics, and a rich in-round event timeline (`gamelog`). Submits a single JSON
payload to a configurable API endpoint at the end of every round.

| `guid` | string | First 8 chars of GUID |
| `name` | string | Player name at round end |
| `rounds` | string | Rounds played |
| `team` | string | Final team |
| `weaponStats` | array | Raw weapon stat tokens (hits, atts, kills, deaths, headshots per weapon) |

| `obj_defused` | object | Same |
| `obj_destroyed` | object | Same |

> **Deprecation notice:** `obj_escort` (one-shot proximity attribution at the map's escort
> announce) was removed in 2.7.0. Its replacement is `obj_vehicle.escort` — cumulative
> per-vehicle time/distance — which tells the whole story instead of a single snapshot.
> The point-in-time facts moved to the gamelog: `vehicle_started.escorts` = who was there
> for the steal, `vehicle_finale.escorts` = who was at the delivery. Parsers reading
> `obj_escort` will simply stop seeing the key.

**`obj_vehicle` fields** (each key optional — only present when earned):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `escort` | object | Per-vehicle map: `{ [vehicle]: { time_s, distance } }` — seconds and game units accrued while alive, on the escorting team, within the escort radius (default 500u) of that vehicle **while it was moving**; accrual keeps accumulating across damage/repair/stop cycles. |
| `damage` | object | `{ damage, hits }` — damage dealt to escort vehicles (`COLLECT_VEHICLE_DAMAGE` only) |
| `repairs` | number | Vehicle repairs completed (`COLLECT_VEHICLE_DAMAGE` only) |

**`stance_stats_seconds` fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `in_prone` | Seconds spent prone |
| `in_crouch` | Seconds crouching (excludes prone / mounted) |
| `in_mg` | Seconds on MG42 / mounted tank / mobile MG |
| `in_lean` | Seconds leaning (excludes prone / mounted) |
| `in_objcarrier` | Seconds carrying a flag/objective |
| `in_vehiclescort` | Seconds connected to a vehicle (tank escort) |
| `in_disguise` | Seconds disguised (covert ops) |
| `in_sprint` | Seconds sprinting (stamina depleting) |
| `in_turtle` | Seconds with zero stamina / full recovery (standing still) |
| `is_downed` | Seconds in downed (revivable) state |

**`activity_stats_seconds` fields:**

Separates time spent *actively involved* from idle camping time. A trigger — using a
weapon or tool, dealing damage, taking damage, or objective work — opens a **3-second
sliding window**; the accumulator advances by the real frame delta while the window is
open. Overlapping triggers extend one window rather than stacking, so a six-round burst
costs one window, not six.

Both clocks run only while the player is **alive** (not downed), the gamestate is
`GS_PLAYING`, and the server is not paused, so `engaged <= alive` always holds and
`engaged / alive` is the engaged-vs-idle ratio. Downed time is excluded from both and is
reported separately as `stance_stats_seconds.is_downed`.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `alive` | Seconds alive and playing — the denominator |
| `engaged` | Seconds actively involved — the **union** of the four windows below, not their sum |
| `from_weapon` | Weapon or tool use, **including shots that miss** — bullets, grenades, syringe, medpack, ammo, pliers, binoculars |
| `from_dmg_dealt` | Damage dealt to another player |
| `from_dmg_taken` | Damage taken from another player |
| `from_objective` | Carrying an objective, pushing a moving escort vehicle, or an objective action (plant, defuse, repair, capture, shove) |

`engaged` is the **union** of the four source windows — it advances whenever any one of
them is open. The four `from_*` fields are **independent durations and therefore overlap**:
each is the real time that source was live, so any one of them is `<= engaged`, but
together they sum to *more* than `engaged`. A player who is carrying the objective while
trading fire accrues in three of them at once.

That means no percentage split is derivable from the breakdown — use `engaged / alive` for
the ratio, and read each `from_*` on its own. The fields are directly comparable between
players: if A shoots B for ten seconds, A's `from_dmg_dealt` and B's `from_dmg_taken` both
reflect it, differing only where one of them was dead or downed (which is excluded from
`alive` and so from every other field too).

World damage (fall, drowning, burning, crushing) and self-inflicted splash open no window
— a self-inflicted panzer already counted under `from_weapon` when the shot was fired.

`from_weapon` counts every shot regardless of `COLLECT_WEAPON_FIRE`: that filter governs
gamelog volume only, and its default excludes all hitscan weapons, so tying activity to it
would leave a rifleman with `from_weapon = 0`. Gamelog output is unaffected.

### `metadata`

Present on every submission. Contains server identity and runtime context — versions, active
gather feature flags, and (when `AUTO_SCORES` is on) the current score state.

| Field | Type | Description |

| `servername` | string | `sv_hostname` |
| `config` | string | `g_customConfig` |
| `stats_version` | string | stats.lua module version |
| `mod_version` | string | ETLegacy mod version |
| `et_version` | string | ET engine version |
| `server_ip` | string | Resolved server IP |
| `server_port` | string | Server port |
| `matchID` | string | Match ID |
| `features` | object \| null | Active gather feature flags (omitted if none) |
| `scores` | object \| null | Current score state (omitted when `AUTO_SCORES` is off or no rounds processed yet — see below) |

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `auto_rename` | Team name enforcement active |
| `auto_sort` | Auto-sort to roster team active |
| `auto_start` | Scheduled-start countdown active |
| `auto_map` | Auto map rotation active |
| `auto_config` | Auto server config active |
| `auto_scores` | Score tracking active |

**`scores` fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `alpha` | number | Alpha team cumulative score |
| `beta` | number | Beta team cumulative score |
| `alpha_teamname` | string \| null | Alpha team display name (gather: from route; ng: tag-detected) |
| `beta_teamname` | string \| null | Beta team display name |
| `completed_maps` | number | Maps fully played (both rounds done) |
| `match_finished` | boolean | True if match is over |
| `match_winner` | `"alpha"` \| `"beta"` \| `"draw"` \| null | Winner, or null if still in progress |
| `round` | object | Summary of the round just processed (see below) |

**`scores.round` fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `map_num` | number | Map number (1–3) |
| `round_num` | number | Round number within the map (1 or 2) |
| `winner` | `"alpha"` \| `"beta"` | Which gather team won this round |
| `winner_et` | number | ET team that won (1=axis, 2=allies) |
| `alpha_side` | number | ET team alpha was playing as this round |
| `fullhold` | boolean | True if `timelimit == nextTimeLimit` (defending team held full time) |

---

### `gamelog`

Ordered array of all events that occurred during the round. Every entry has:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `match_id` | string | Match ID (injected at save time) |
| `round_id` | number | Round number (injected at save time) |
| `unixtime` | number | Wall-clock timestamp in **milliseconds** when the event was recorded. |
| `leveltime` | number | Server level time (ms) when the event was recorded. Raw as emitted — see the pause note below. Path telemetry (`carrier_pos` / `vehicle_pos`) is the one exception: it carries the time the *position* was sampled, which can be a few frames before the event was emitted (see the `carrier_pos` section). |
| `group` | string | `"player"`, `"server"` or `"vehicle"` |
| `label` | string | Event type (see below) |
| ...fields | — | Event-specific fields |

> **Pauses.** `leveltime` and `unixtime` are emitted **raw** and keep advancing while a match is
> paused (`/pause`, `ref pause`, vote pause, techpause, timeouts), so a paused round leaves a gap
> in the timeline. The script does **not** correct this itself — it only emits a `pause` /
> `unpause` server-event pair (see below) bracketing each pause. Downstream ingest removes the
> paused time by subtracting `unpause.leveltime − pause.leveltime` from subsequent events, so the
> stored/served timeline reflects actual gameplay. This keeps the lua engine-agnostic: if a future
> engine instead freezes the clock during a pause, the markers simply show no drift and ingest
> does nothing.

#### Event types

**`spawn`** — player spawned (not a revive)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | GUID |
| `team` | Team number |
| `class` | Class name |
| `weapons` | Array of notable weapon names at spawn (absent for medic/fieldop or when no notable weapon active) |

**`kill`** — player killed an enemy

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `killer` | GUID |
| `victim` | GUID |
| `weapon` | meansOfDeath constant |
| `killer_health` | Killer health at moment of kill |
| `killer_class` | `soldier`, `medic`, `engineer`, `fieldop`, `covertops` |
| `killer_pos` | `"x y z"` |
| `killer_stance` | Stance snapshot (see below) |
| `victim_class` | Class |
| `victim_pos` | `"x y z"` |
| `victim_stance` | Stance snapshot |
| `allies_alive` | Allies alive at moment of kill |
| `axis_alive` | Axis alive at moment of kill |
| `killer_reinf` | Seconds until killer's team next reinforce wave |
| `victim_reinf` | Seconds until victim's team next reinforce wave |

**`suicide`** — self-kill or world-kill

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | GUID |
| `weapon` | meansOfDeath |
| `team` | Team number of the dying player |
| `victim_class` | Class |
| `victim_pos` | `"x y z"` |
| `victim_stance` | Stance snapshot |
| `victim_reinf` | Seconds until the dying player's team next reinforce wave |

**`teamkill`** — killed a teammate

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `killer` | GUID |
| `victim` | GUID |
| `weapon` | meansOfDeath |
| `killer_class` | Class |
| `killer_stance` | Stance snapshot |
| `victim_class` | Class |
| `victim_health` | Victim health at time of kill |
| `victim_stance` | Stance snapshot |
| `victim_reinf` | Seconds until victim's team next reinforce wave |

**`damage`** — every damage event (high volume)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `killer` | GUID of attacker (or `"WORLD"`) |
| `victim` | GUID |
| `damage` | Damage amount |
| `damage_flags` | Damage flags bitmask |
| `weapon` | meansOfDeath |
| `hit_region` | `HR_HEAD`, `HR_ARMS`, `HR_BODY`, `HR_LEGS`, `HR_NONE` — see note below |
| `killer_health` / `killer_class` / `killer_pos` / `killer_stance` | Attacker context |
| `victim_health` / `victim_class` / `victim_pos` / `victim_stance` | Victim context |

> **`HR_NONE` note** — `HR_NONE` does not indicate a miss; it means the engine hit-region delta could not be
> determined for this damage event. Based on match data (~27% of all damage events are `HR_NONE`), the
> causes break down as follows:
>
> | Cause | ~% | Explanation |
> |---|---|---|
> | Dead body hit | 66% | Target was already dead; engine skips `G_LogRegionHit` for dead targets so the attacker's `hitRegions` counter never increments |
> | Splash / explosive | 31% | Radius damage has no body-part detection (`DAMAGE_RADIUS` flag set); `G_LogRegionHit` is never called |
> | Cache init | 1.5% | First damage event from an attacker each round; the Lua-side delta cache is seeded on the first call and always returns `HR_NONE` |
> | No victim | 1.3% | Damage to a non-tracked entity (spectator slot, world object, etc.) |
>
> `hit_region` is derived by delta-comparing the attacker's `pers.playerStats.hitRegions[0..3]` counters
> (HEAD/ARMS/BODY/LEGS) between consecutive `et_Damage` callbacks.  The engine only increments these
> counters for direct hits on living players, which is why the above scenarios all produce `HR_NONE`.
> `HR_NONE` is a Lua-level sentinel (`-1`) — it does not exist in the engine's `hitRegion_t` enum.

**`revive`** — medic revived a downed player

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | Medic GUID (from `et_Revive` engine callback) |
| `victim` | Revived player GUID |
| `player_pos` | `"x y z"` medic origin at moment of revive |
| `player_stance` | Medic stance snapshot |
| `victim_pos` | `"x y z"` revivee origin at moment of revive |
| `victim_stance` | Revivee stance snapshot |

**`class_change`** — player switched class

| `player` | GUID |
| `class` | New class name |

**`message`** — chat / vsay

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | GUID |
| `command` | `say`, `say_team`, `say_teamNL`, `say_buddy`, `say_buddyNL`, `vsay`, `vsay_team`, `vsay_buddy` |
| `message` | Message text (vsay: sound key; say: full text) |
| `vsay_text` | Custom text for vsay commands with extra args (optional) |

**Objective events** — `obj_planted`, `obj_defused`, `obj_destroyed`, `obj_repaired`,
`obj_taken`, `obj_repickup`, `obj_secured`, `obj_returned`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | GUID |
| `objective` | Objective name from config |
| `pos` | `"x y z"` — the acting player's origin when the event fired. See the table below for the exceptions. |
| `run` | Carry-run id, on the labels that bound a run (`obj_taken`, `obj_repickup`, `obj_secured`, `obj_returned`). See [Grouping samples into runs](#grouping-samples-into-runs) for what it means on each. 2.7.2+ |

> **Changed in 2.7.2.** Before 2.7.2 only the carry cycle carried a position
> (`obj_taken` / `obj_repickup` / `obj_secured`, plus `obj_dropped`); everything else had
> none, which is why plants, defuses, destructions, repairs and flag captures could not be
> drawn on a replay. No version gate is needed to consume this: an event either carries a
> position or it does not, and older reports simply show fewer markers.

Where each position comes from:

| Label | `pos` is |
|-------|----------|
| `obj_taken`, `obj_repickup` | where the carry run started |
| `obj_secured` | where it ended — the same reading as the run's final `carrier_pos` |
| `obj_dropped` | where the objective was lost, likewise shared with the closing sample |
| `obj_planted`, `obj_defused` | the engineer's origin, i.e. the charge |
| `obj_repaired` | the engineer's origin |
| `obj_returned` | the returner's origin — they had to reach the objective to return it, so this is where it was lying. A `WORLD` return (the objective timing out back to its stand after being dropped and left) has no actor and falls back to the position the carry ended at, which is the same spot |
| `obj_destroyed` | **dynamite:** the position the charge was *planted* at, remembered from `obj_planted` — the destruction fires ~30s after the plant, by which time the planter is usually dead or respawned across the map. **Announce-only destructions** (command posts, satchel, direct fire): the destroyed entity's own origin, taken from the `et_Damage` record that attributed it. Never the attacker's position — a satchel has to be placed on the target, but a panzerfaust or tank shell can take a command post from across the map |

`pos` is absent only when no trustworthy source existed: an origin reading that failed
validation (see the `carrier_pos` section on closing points), or a brush entity reporting
`0 0 0`. An absent `pos` is always a deliberate omission rather than a zero — the field is
simply not present, and never a placeholder coordinate.

**`obj_carrierkilled`** — killed an enemy objective carrier (killer-credited; never
emitted for selfkills, teamkills, or world deaths)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | Killer GUID |
| `victim` | Carrier GUID |
| `objective` | Objective the victim was carrying |
| `weapon` | meansOfDeath |
| `pos` | Killer origin (follows `kill`'s `killer_pos`). 2.7.2+ |
| `victim_pos` | Carrier origin — where the objective went down, and the same reading as the run's closing `carrier_pos`. This is the useful one for a replay. 2.7.2+ |
| `run` | The **victim's** carry run that this kill ended. The event is credited to the killer but describes the victim's run. 2.7.2+ |

Attribution comes from the engine console lines directly (`Item:` line preceding the
steal/return popup, `Objective_Destroyed: <clientNum>`, `Repair: <clientNum>`); announce-only
destructions (e.g. command posts) are attributed via the most recent `et_Damage` hit on the
entity. `obj_taken` is the initial steal from the stand; `obj_repickup` is a pickup of a
dropped objective.

**`obj_dropped`** — carrier lost the objective without securing/returning it: death,
disconnect, or a manual `+dropobj`. Manual drops emit no console line at all — they are
detected by polling the carrier's flag powerup (`PW_REDFLAG`/`PW_BLUEFLAG`) each frame.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | GUID of the carrier who dropped it |
| `objective` | Objective name from config |
| `pos` | `"x y z"` drop position (absent if unresolvable) |

**Vehicle events** (`group: "vehicle"`) — emitted by entity-state tracking of escort
vehicles (script_movers), enabled by `COLLECT_VEHICLE_STATS`. All carry a `vehicle` field
(the entity's scriptName, e.g. `"tank"`).

| Label | Extra fields | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| `vehicle_started` | `pos`, `escorts?` | Vehicle moved for the first time this round — `escorts` = who was there for the steal |
| `vehicle_moving` | `pos`, `escorts?` | Vehicle resumed moving after a stop |
| `vehicle_stopped` | `pos`, `segment_distance`, `escorts?` | No displacement for >1s; distance of the completed segment |
| `vehicle_damaged` | `player?`, `pos` | Health hit 0 (disabled); `player` = last damager if attributable |
| `vehicle_repaired` | `player?`, `pos` | Health restored; `player` = repairing engineer via `Repair:` line |
| `vehicle_pos` | `pos`, `escorts?` | Path-vertex position sample while moving (`COLLECT_VEHICLE_TELEMETRY` only) |
| `vehicle_damage` | `player`, `damage` | Per-hit vehicle damage, clamped to the vehicle's remaining health (`COLLECT_VEHICLE_DAMAGE` only) |
| `vehicle_finale` | `pos`, `escorts?` | The map's escort announce fired (destination reached); `escorts` = owning-team players at the destination |
| `vehicle_summary` | `total_distance`, `moving_time_s`, `damaged_count`, `repaired_count` | One per vehicle that entered play, at round end |

`escorts` is the array of player GUIDs accruing escort credit at that moment (alive,
escorting team, within the escort radius while the vehicle moves); omitted when empty.

**`obj_damage`** — damage to a non-vehicle damageable objective (command post, breach walls,
barriers); `COLLECT_VEHICLE_DAMAGE` only. Restricted to `ET_CONSTRUCTIBLE` entities — the
engine fires the damage hook for every damageable entity, so corpse gib damage (`ET_CORPSE`)
and decorative breakables (`func_explosive`, `props_*` chairs/windows/paintings) are filtered
out here rather than polluting the stream. `damage` is clamped to the objective's remaining
health so an overkill (e.g. an airstrike on a near-dead wall) reports only the fraction that
landed. Trucks never emit these: they are not damageable (`takedamage 0`).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | Attacker GUID |
| `damage` | Damage dealt, clamped to the objective's remaining health |
| `target` | Entity name (objective `track`, falling back to scriptName/classname) |

**`carrier_pos`** — objective-carrier position sample (`COLLECT_VEHICLE_TELEMETRY` only)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | Carrier GUID |
| `objective` | Objective being carried |
| `pos` | `"x y z"` path vertex — see below |
| `run` | Carry-run id — see [Grouping samples into runs](#grouping-samples-into-runs). 2.7.2+ |

Carrier and vehicle positions are read every frame but emitted only where the path
turns (`stats/util/pathgate.lua`), because these points are drawn as a polyline: a
fixed cadence oversamples straight corridors while still cutting corners, and a
carrier at `g_speed 320` covers ~400 units in a second. The emitted polyline stays
within ~48 units of the real path (~64 for vehicles), with extra points at height
changes, at direction reversals, on coming to a stop, and once a second while
stationary. Spacing is therefore irregular — consume it by `leveltime`, never by
assuming a fixed interval.

**Carriers additionally have a 10 Hz spacing floor while they are moving** (2.7.2+,
`move_gap_ms`). Corner vertices alone describe a route's shape but chord across it, so a
strafe-jumped or circle-strafed approach measures shorter than it was; the floor puts
samples ~32 units apart at `g_speed 320`, inside the corridor tolerance, so the polyline
is the route rather than an approximation of it. The floor is gated on distance covered,
not on frame count, so volume remains independent of `sv_fps` (which ranges 40–125 across
the shipped configs) — verified at 49 points for the same ground at `sv_fps` 125, 50 and
20. A carrier standing still never trips it and stays on the 1 Hz keepalive.

Vehicles keep pure vertex gating: an escort truck runs 8+ minutes on a fixed spline, where
a floor would cost thousands of points and buy no fidelity.

Budget: the floor costs ~1.6x total gamelog events on the heaviest round in the reference
set (`decay_sw` round 1, 212.6s of carry time — 423 `carrier_pos` before, ~2100 after).
Expect roughly `10 x carry_seconds` samples per round.

#### Grouping samples into runs

From 2.7.2 every `carrier_pos` carries a `run`, a per-round id allocated on each pickup and
shared with the events that bound that carry. **Group by `run` to partition a round's
samples into carries.** Ids start at 1 each round, count in pickup order, and are shared
across objectives.

| Label | Relationship to `run` |
|-------|-----------------------|
| `obj_taken`, `obj_repickup` | opens the run |
| `carrier_pos` | belongs to it |
| `obj_secured`, `obj_dropped` | closes it |
| `obj_carrierkilled` | closes it — credited to the killer, but the id is the **victim's** run |
| `obj_returned` | names the run it **terminated**, which has normally already closed. An objective is returned while it lies on the ground, so the return follows an `obj_dropped` rather than ending a live carry: the id says this carry ended in a reset rather than in someone picking the objective back up. After a re-pickup it names the latest run, not the first. |

This is not a convenience. `(player, objective)` does not identify a carry: on
`karsiah_te2` round 1 of match `075fe912` a single player takes `north_documents` four
separate times. Before 2.7.2 the only way to partition was to replay the surrounding
events in array order, and a consumer that gets that state machine wrong fuses two
disjoint carries into one and draws a segment across the map. Pre-2.7.2 reports still
require that fallback.

**`leveltime` is when the position was sampled, not when the event was emitted.** A
corner vertex is only recognised once the entity has moved off the corridor, so it
is emitted a few frames late (measured worst case ~150ms) and backdated to the frame
it was actually sampled at. Coordinate and timestamp therefore always describe the
same instant, at the cost of `carrier_pos` sometimes appearing in the array slightly
after an event with a later `leveltime`. Within one run the samples are non-decreasing
in `leveltime` and none exceeds the event that ends the run; across runs and across
carriers the streams interleave, so ordering *between* them is `event_index`, i.e. array
order. (This holds from 2.7.2 — see the clock note below for what pre-2.7.2 reports do.)

Each carry run is closed out with a final `carrier_pos` at the exact position where
it ended, emitted before the `obj_secured` / `obj_dropped` / `obj_carrierkilled` event
that ends it, and nothing is emitted for that player afterwards. Without it the drawn
route would stop at the last corner, up to `max_seg` (512u) short of the truth. It is
skipped only when the run happened to end on a point the gate had already emitted.

From 2.7.2 that closing origin is **validated before use**, and the run-ending event reuses
the same reading rather than taking its own. A reading is rejected if it is missing, exactly
`0 0 0`, or further from the last sampled vertex than a player could have travelled (2000u).
The `handle_disconnect` path is why: it runs from `et_ClientDisconnect`, where the entity may
already be torn down. When a reading is rejected the closing sample is omitted and the
run-ending event carries **no `pos`** — the event itself is still emitted. Two guarantees
follow: `obj_secured` / `obj_dropped` / `obj_carrierkilled.victim_pos` always equal the run's
final `carrier_pos`, and no coordinate is ever a placeholder.

> **Changed in 2.7.2 — affects reading stored reports.** On 2.7.1 and earlier, `carrier_pos`
> and `vehicle_pos` are stamped on the engine's frame clock while every other event is
> stamped with `et.trap_Milliseconds()`. The two run several seconds apart (measured ~10.2s
> on `karsiah_te2` round 1 of match `075fe912`, ~3.3s for `vehicle_pos` on `supply`), so in
> those reports telemetry `leveltime` is **not comparable** to any other event's, samples
> appear after `round_end`, and each run's closing point sorts *before* its own approach —
> which draws as a straight line across the map. **Read pre-2.7.2 telemetry in array order,
> not `leveltime` order**; the coordinates themselves are correct and the routes are
> continuous when read that way. From 2.7.2 both clocks are the timeline clock and either
> ordering works.

> **Changed in 2.7.1.** Rounds recorded on 2.7.0 carry `carrier_pos` / `vehicle_pos` at a
> flat 1s cadence, with the emit-time `leveltime` and no closing point. They remain valid
> input — spacing was never load-bearing — but a 2.7.0 route is corner-cut by up to ~400
> units and ends short of the objective, so per-round route comparisons across the boundary
> are not like-for-like. `ComputeCarrierDistances` totals shift slightly for the same reason:
> corner chords stop cutting corners (more accurate, marginally higher) while sub-tolerance
> strafe jitter stops being counted (marginally lower).

**`obj_flag_captured`**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | GUID |
| `flag` | Flag name (`allies_flag`, `axis_flag`, or config key) |
| `pos` | The credited player's origin. 2.7.2+ |
| `flag_pos` | The checkpoint entity's own position. 2.7.2+ |

Credit is proximity-based and given to every player within range of the flag, so one capture
can produce several events: `pos` says who was there, `flag_pos` says where "there" was and is
the same on all of them.

**`pickup`** — console-log pickup/use event

`Item:` is the canonical pickup/use signal. When `Ammo_Pack:` or `Health_Pack:` appears on the same log frame, it attributes that same pickup to another player's pack instead of creating a second event.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | GUID |
| `item` | Raw item token from the log, e.g. `item_health`, `weapon_magicammo`, `weapon_mp40`, `weapon_thompson` |
| `owner` | GUID of the player whose health/ammo pack was used (optional; absent for self-use and generic weapon pickups) |
| `pos` | `"x y z"` player origin at the time the line was processed |
| `stance` | Stance snapshot for the acting player |
| `owner_pos` | `"x y z"` owner origin at the time the line was processed (optional) |
| `owner_stance` | Owner stance snapshot (optional) |

**`shove`**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | Shover GUID |
| `victim` | Shoved player GUID |
| `player_pos` | `"x y z"` shover origin at moment of shove |
| `player_stance` | Shover stance snapshot |
| `victim_pos` | `"x y z"` shoved player origin at moment of shove |
| `victim_stance` | Shoved player stance snapshot |

**`weapon_fire`** — a weapon shot; present only for the weapons selected by `COLLECT_WEAPON_FIRE`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player` | GUID |
| `weapon` | `et.WP_*` weapon constant |
| `pos` | `"x y z"` player origin at time of shot |
| `pitch` | View pitch (degrees, 1 decimal) |
| `yaw` | View yaw (degrees, 1 decimal) |
| `stance` | Stance snapshot (see below) |

**Server events** (`group: "server"`)

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `round_start` | Emitted when gamestate transitions to GS_PLAYING |
| `round_end` | Emitted when gamestate transitions to GS_INTERMISSION |
| `pause` | Match was paused during a live round (any pause vector). Emitted at the pause's raw `leveltime`. |
| `unpause` | Match resumed. Ingest subtracts `unpause.leveltime − pause.leveltime` from later events; real pause length = `unpause.unixtime − pause.unixtime`. |

**Stance snapshot** (embedded in kill / teamkill / damage / pickup / weapon_fire events):

| `API_URL_SUBMIT` | `"https://…/stats/submit"` | POST endpoint that receives the final JSON payload |
| `API_URL_VERSION` | `"https://…/stats/version"` | GET endpoint that returns `{ version }` |

The match-ID endpoint is called as `GET {API_URL_MATCHID}/{server_ip}/{server_port}`.

### [PATHS]

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `JSON_FILEPATH` | `""` (auto-detect) | Shared output directory for both `stats.log` and JSON dumps (when `DUMP_STATS_DATA = true`). Empty auto-resolves to `<fs_homepath>/legacy/`. Override via `STATS_API_PATH`. |
| `LOG_FILEPATH` | derived | Always `JSON_FILEPATH .. "stats.log"` — not configurable separately. Set `STATS_API_PATH` to relocate both outputs. |

### [COLLECTION]

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LOGGING_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable/disable the log file entirely |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `"info"` | `"info"` logs key lifecycle events. `"debug"` logs every per-event trace (verbose, high volume — only use for troubleshooting). |
| `COLLECT_GAMELOG` | `true` | Record the in-round event timeline. Disabling this also suppresses kills, damage, chat, objectives, revives, class changes, and shoves from the output. |
| `COLLECT_WEAPON_FIRE` | `"spam,utility,support,-pliers"` | Which weapon shots to record as `weapon_fire` gamelog events. A comma-separated spec — see [Weapon-fire filter](#weapon-fire-filter) below. Covers both player weapons and fixed MG42s. |
| `COLLECT_OBJ_STATS` | `true` | Objective stats in `player_stats` (plant/defuse/destroy/etc.) |
| `COLLECT_SHOVE_STATS` | `true` | Shove tracking in `player_stats` and `gamelog` |
| `COLLECT_MOVEMENT_STATS` | `true` | Distance travelled and speed in `player_stats` |
| `COLLECT_STANCE_STATS` | `true` | Stance-time breakdown in `player_stats` |
| `COLLECT_ACTIVITY_STATS` | `true` | Engaged-vs-idle time breakdown in `player_stats` |
| `COLLECT_VEHICLE_STATS` | `true` | Entity-state escort vehicle tracking: per-player escort credit (`player_stats.obj_vehicle.escort`) and `vehicle_*` timeline events in `gamelog`. Active only on maps with an `escort` config section — its entry names (or `script_name` keys) pin the vehicle script_movers; maps without one have no vehicle and are skipped entirely. |
| `COLLECT_VEHICLE_TELEMETRY` | `true` | Path position samples for moving vehicles (`vehicle_pos`) and objective carriers (`carrier_pos`), enabling route replay. Sampled per frame; volume is independent of `sv_fps` in both cases. **Vehicles** emit only where the path turns — at or below one point per second (~200 events per escort round). **Carriers** additionally hold a 10 Hz floor while moving (2.7.2+), giving ~32 units between samples so carry distance is measured rather than estimated: expect roughly `10 x carry_seconds` per round (~2100 on the heaviest round measured, versus 423 under pure vertex gating), and 1 Hz while a carrier stands still. |
| `COLLECT_VEHICLE_DAMAGE` | `true` | Per-player damage tracking for damageable objectives: `vehicle_damage` events + `player_stats.obj_vehicle.damage` / `.repairs` for vehicles, and `obj_damage` events for `ET_CONSTRUCTIBLE` objectives (command posts, breach walls, barriers). Corpse gibs and decorative breakables are filtered out; damage is clamped to remaining health. Trucks are not damageable and never emit these. |

#### Weapon-fire filter

`COLLECT_WEAPON_FIRE` / `STATS_API_WEAPON_FIRE` selects *which* weapons produce
`weapon_fire` events. Recording every bullet is tens of thousands of events per round and
is not production-viable; recording only the projectile weapons is a few hundred and is.

```
STATS_API_WEAPON_FIRE=spam,utility,support,-pliers # default
STATS_API_WEAPON_FIRE=false                        # off. "none", "off", "0" also work
STATS_API_WEAPON_FIRE=true                         # every weapon. "all" also works. Very high volume
STATS_API_WEAPON_FIRE=spam                         # non-hitscan combat weapons
STATS_API_WEAPON_FIRE=hitscan                      # trace weapons only
STATS_API_WEAPON_FIRE=5,34,53                      # explicit weapon ids
STATS_API_WEAPON_FIRE=panzerfaust,mortar           # explicit weapon names
STATS_API_WEAPON_FIRE=spam,-flamethrower           # a class minus one member
```

Tokens are comma-separated, trimmed and case-insensitive. A leading `-` negates. All
positives are unioned first and all negatives subtracted afterwards, so **token order
never matters**. Names are the `WP_` constant lowercased with the prefix stripped
(`panzerfaust`, `grenade_launcher`, `mortar_set`) — no aliases.

| Class | Weapons |
|-------|---------|
| `spam` | Panzerfaust, bazooka, artillery, airstrike call, all four mortars, map mortar, both hand grenades, both rifle grenades, flamethrower, dynamite, landmine |
| `hitscan` | Every trace weapon: SMGs, pistols and akimbos, rifles and scoped rifles, MG42/Browning mobile and deployed, the fixed MG42, both knives |
| `utility` | Syringe, satchel + detonator, covert smoke |
| `support` | Ammo pack, medkit, binoculars, pliers, adrenaline |
| `all`     | Everything | 
### [OUTPUT]

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DUMP_STATS_DATA` | `false` | Write an indented local JSON file to `JSON_FILEPATH` after each round. File name: `stats-{matchID}-{datetime}-{map}-round-{N}.json` |
| `SUBMIT_TO_API` | `true` | Submit stats to `API_URL_SUBMIT`. Set `false` to write locally only (useful for debugging with `DUMP_STATS_DATA = true`). |

### [GATHER FEATURES]

Gather features only activate when the match-manager API returns a route for this server with
the corresponding flag set (`auto_rename`, `auto_sort`, `auto_start`). They have no effect on ng (non-gather) matches.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTO_RENAME` | `false` | Enforce team roster names from the match-manager API. Names are populated after WAITING_REPORT; the module re-polls until they arrive. |
| `AUTO_SORT` | `false` | Assign connecting spectators to their roster team during GS_WARMUP only. Never moves players already in team 1 or 2. |
| `AUTO_START` | `false` | Countdown to `scheduled_start` from match data and force-start via `ref allready`. Includes a late-join 5-second countdown if all players arrive after the scheduled time. |
| `AUTO_MAP` | `false` | Automatically switch to the next map in the match rotation after round 2 intermission ends. |
| `AUTO_CONFIG` | `false` | Apply server config via `ref config <name>` based on roster player count at map 1 round 1 warmup. |
| `AUTO_SCORES` | `true` | Track match scores using ET stopwatch rules. Active for **gather matches** (requires `auto_scores=true` in match data, BO3 termination enforced) and **ng matches** (always-on when no gather match is active, scores accumulate indefinitely). Embeds current score state into stats submissions as `metadata.scores`. Announces score in chat during intermission. |
| `VERSION_CHECK` | `true` | Check `API_URL_VERSION` at startup and broadcast a chat warning if outdated |

### [AUTO-CONFIG MAP]

Maps total registered player count to a server config name, applied once via `ref config <name>` at the start of map 1 round 1 warmup. `AUTO_CONFIG` must be enabled. Resolution selects the smallest threshold that is ≥ the actual player count.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTO_CONFIG_MAP[2]` | `"legacy1"` | Config for 1–2 player matches |
| `AUTO_CONFIG_MAP[4]` | `"legacy3"` | Config for 3–4 player matches |
| `AUTO_CONFIG_MAP[6]` | `"legacy3"` | Config for 5–6 player matches |
| `AUTO_CONFIG_MAP[10]` | `"legacy5"` | Config for 7–10 player matches |
| `AUTO_CONFIG_MAP[12]` | `"legacy6"` | Config for 11–12 player matches |

Player count is taken from the registered gather roster (`alpha_team` + `beta_team` in the match-manager route), not from connected players. If no threshold matches and the API provided a `server_config` value, that is used as fallback.

### [AUTO-START TIMING]

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTO_START_WAIT_INITIAL` | `300` | Seconds before force-start on the first round of a match (map 1, round 1). **Simple mode only.** |
| `AUTO_START_WAIT` | `120` | Seconds before force-start on all subsequent rounds. |

### [AUTO-START PHASED MODE]

Splits the very first start of a match into two phases. Subsequent rounds still use the single
`AUTO_START_WAIT` timer.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTO_START_MODE` | `"simple"` | `"simple"` uses `AUTO_START_WAIT_INITIAL` for map 1 round 1. `"phased"` runs a connect phase followed by a ready phase. |
| `AUTO_START_CONNECT_WAIT` | `180` | Seconds for the connect phase. T-60 / T-10 / T-0 warnings fire over chat and to the API. At T-0, any rostered player whose GUID never connected to the server is banned, then the ready phase begins. |
| `AUTO_START_READY_WAIT` | `120` | Seconds for the ready phase that follows the connect phase. Behaves like the normal auto-start window: T-60 / T-10 / T-0 warnings, then `ref allready` if balanced + all present; otherwise late-joiners trigger a 10-second force-start countdown. |

Bans/warnings dispatch through the existing `/matches/auto-start/notify` endpoint with a new
`phase` field (`"connect"` | `"ready"`). Players missing from voice **or** the server at T-0 of
either phase are punished (subject to channel-level `auto_ban` setting).

### [TIMING]

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `STORE_TIME_INTERVAL` | `5000` | Milliseconds between weapon-stats snapshots during a round |
| `SAVE_STATS_DELAY` | `3000` | Milliseconds to wait after intermission starts before submitting stats (avoids lag at the exact transition) |

### [ENV OVERRIDES]

silently ignored and the defaults above apply.

## config.toml

`luascripts/config.toml` contains **only** map-specific objective patterns and common
buildable patterns. API credentials, paths, and feature flags have been removed from it.

### Common buildables

Buildables shared across all maps (command post, MG nest). Each has `construct` and `destruct`
pattern arrays, plus a `plant` array for dynamite attribution.

```toml
[common_buildables.command_post.patterns]
construct = ["command post constructed"]
destruct   = ["command post destroyed"]
plant      = ["planted at the command post"]
```

### Map sections

Each map is declared under `[maps.<mapname>]`. Supported sub-sections:

| Section | Keys | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `objectives.<name>` | `steal_pattern`, `secured_pattern`, `return_pattern` | Flag/document steal+secure cycle |
| `buildables.<name>` | `construct_pattern`, `destruct_pattern`, `plant_pattern` | Map-specific constructibles |
| `buildables.<name>` | `enabled = true` | Marks a common buildable as present on this map |
| `flags.<name>` | `flag_pattern`, `flag_coordinates` | Checkpoint / flag capture attribution |
| `misc.<name>` | `misc_pattern`, `misc_coordinates` | Coordinate-based misc objective |
| `escort.<name>` | `escort_pattern`, `escort_coordinates` | Escort finale detection: when the announce matching `escort_pattern` fires, a `vehicle_finale` event is emitted listing the owning-team players within the escort radius of `escort_coordinates` (falling back to the vehicle's position) |
| `escort.<name>` | `script_name`, `team`, `radius` | Entity-state vehicle tracking (the presence of an `escort` section enables it for the map). The vehicle script_mover is pinned by `script_name`, or by `<name>` itself when omitted (`escort.tank` → scriptName `tank`). Optional: escorting `team` (defaults to `"allies"` — attackers own escort objectives on every map in rotation; set `"axis"` for the rare inverted map) and escort `radius` (default 500 units) |

---

## Gather features

All gather features require the match-manager API to return a route for this server with
the corresponding flag set. They have no effect on ng (non-gather) matches.

### AUTO_RENAME

Enforces player names against the roster returned by the match-manager API:

1. **Warmup** — API is polled when the first player readies up. Team data is cached in
   `luascripts/team_data.json`. If names are not yet populated (gather phase 1 — before
   WAITING_REPORT), the module stays stale and re-polls until `auto_rename=true` arrives.
2. **Warmup countdown** — API is called again for a fresh fetch; all current players are
   validated.
3. **GS_PLAYING** — team data is loaded from the local file only (no API calls during a
   live round). Names are re-checked every 5 seconds.
4. **Intermission** — team data file is wiped so stale data does not survive into the next
   match.

Spectator names are prefixed with `spectator_teamname` from the API response (if present),
truncated to 35 characters.

### AUTO_SORT

Assigns a connecting player to their roster team on connect, during GS_WARMUP only.
Only moves players currently in spectator (team 3). Never touches players already in
team 1 (Axis) or team 2 (Allies). Respects `sides_swapped` from match data.

### AUTO_START

Runs a countdown to `scheduled_start` and calls `ref allready` when all roster players are
present. If the match fails to start (missing players), a notification is sent to the API.
If all players join after the scheduled time while still in GS_WARMUP, a late-join countdown
triggers automatically.

Two modes (set via `AUTO_START_MODE`):

- **`simple`** (default) — one window per round. Map 1 round 1 uses `AUTO_START_WAIT_INITIAL`;
  every other round uses `AUTO_START_WAIT`.
- **`phased`** — only the very first start of a match runs as two windows: a **connect phase**
  (`AUTO_START_CONNECT_WAIT`) that bans rostered players who never connect, followed by a
  **ready phase** (`AUTO_START_READY_WAIT`) that bans players missing from the server or voice
  at T-0 and force-starts the match. Subsequent rounds keep the simple short timer.

State machine (`gather.tick`):
`IDLE → ARMED → WARNING_60 → WARNING_10 → COUNTDOWN → START_ATTEMPT → DONE`
with a `└→ LATE_JOIN_COUNTDOWN` branch from `DONE` for late joiners during the ready phase.
In phased mode, `START_ATTEMPT` at connect-T-0 dispatches connect-phase bans and re-arms
the same state machine with a fresh `scheduled_start = now + AUTO_START_READY_WAIT`.

#### Resilience to API outages

All HTTP from `api.lua` (match-ID fetch, route validation, version check) is non-blocking:
calls fire in the background and dispatch results through `util/http.poll_pending()` on
each `et_RunFrame`. If the API host is unreachable, the game loop does not stall.

The auto-start countdown is gated for safety: at T-60 the state machine requires both a
cached `team_data` payload **and** a positive route-validation result before any warning
fires. If either is unavailable, the countdown is suppressed (`STATE_DONE` with a log entry)
rather than running blind — admins can still issue `ref allready` manually.

### AUTO_SCORES

Tracks match scores using ET stopwatch rules. Operates in two modes depending on whether a
gather match is active:

**Gather mode** — activated when `AUTO_SCORES=true` and the match-manager route carries
`is_gather=true`. Enforces BO3 termination (match ends at 3 pts or after map 3). Score state
persists across round resets (wiped only on a new `match_id`).

**ng (non-gather) mode** — activated when `AUTO_SCORES=true` and the route does not carry
`is_gather=true` (scrims, tournaments, public matches). Scores accumulate indefinitely with no
BO3 termination. Match identity is maintained across `et_InitGame` restarts via GUID
continuity: if ≥65% of the in-team GUIDs from round 1 are still present at round 2 start, the
match continues; otherwise a new match is started. State is persisted to
`{match_id}_team_data.json` between restarts.

Both modes embed the current score state into every stats submission under `metadata.scores` and announce the score in chat during intermission.


Scoring rules (both modes):

- **Map win** (team wins both rounds): +2 pts to winner
- **Map draw** (split 1-1): +1 pt each
- **Fullhold** (`timelimit == nextTimeLimit`): defending team gets provisional +1 after r1
  - **Double fullhold** (both teams hold): provisional removed, +1 each
  - **Normal r2 after r1 fullhold**: provisional removed, normal result applied
- **Clinch** (only possible at 2-0 + r1 fullhold provisional = 3-0): match ends before r2 *(gather only)*

Team-side validation (gather mode): connected player GUIDs are matched against the alpha
roster from match data. If ≥80% of matched players are on the expected ET team, the assignment
is confirmed; otherwise the detected side is used. Falls back to the static side table if
detection is inconclusive.

Possible final scores (gather): **3-0** (clinch), **4-0**, **3-1**, **4-2**, **3-3** (draw).

### Required Lua libraries

Both must be available to the ETLegacy Lua runtime (present in `lualibs/`):

- `dkjson` — JSON encode/decode
- `toml` — TOML parser
