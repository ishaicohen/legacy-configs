    Vertex-preserving position sampling for path telemetry.

    Streaming Reumann-Witkam: the last emitted point is the anchor, the
    direction it left in defines a corridor, and the corridor being violated
    means a vertex is due. Extra gates cover the cases a pure corridor test
    misses -- a 180-degree reversal keeps perpendicular deviation at zero, a
    ladder/fall changes only z, and a stationary entity produces no geometry
    at all (keepalive keeps the ingest side's segment anchors fresh).

    Corner vertices alone describe a route's shape but chord across it, which
    under-measures a path that weaves inside the corridor. Profiles that need
    the distance to be right as well as the shape set move_gap_ms, a spacing
    floor applied while the entity is actually covering ground.

    Usage:
        local gate = pathgate.new(pathgate.CARRIER)
        local vertex, vertex_ms = gate:sample(origin, level_time)  -- every frame
        if vertex then emit(utils.fmt_pos(vertex), vertex_ms) end
        gate:reset()                                     -- new run / round

    A corner vertex is necessarily a *past* sample: the corridor is only known
    to be violated after the entity has already moved off it, so the point that
    belongs on the polyline is the one from before the violation. sample()
    therefore returns that point's own leveltime alongside it, and callers must
    stamp the event with it -- otherwise the coordinate and the timestamp
    describe different moments. Every other gate (stop, heartbeat, height,
    segment cap) needs no lookback and returns the live sample at `now`.

-- Tunables, in game units / ms.
--   tol_xy      corridor half-width; bounds how far the drawn polyline may
--               deviate from the real path
--   tol_z       vertical change from the anchor that forces a vertex
--   max_seg     hard cap on straight-line segment length
--   keepalive_ms  heartbeat while the entity is parked within min_dir_seg of
--               the anchor. Deliberately does NOT apply while moving: a clock
--               tick would otherwise pre-empt the geometry and drop the vertex
--               wherever the timer happened to fire instead of on the corner
--   max_gap_ms  absolute cap on the interval between points, so even a prone
--               crawl stays well inside the ingest side's segment gap limit
--   move_gap_ms sample floor while actually covering ground: once the entity is
--               min_dir_seg from the anchor, no more than this long may pass
--               without a point. 0 disables it, leaving pure vertex gating.
--               Gated on distance rather than on the per-sample `moving` flag
--               because that flag is frame-rate dependent -- at sv_fps 125 a
--               sprint covers 2.56u per sample, barely over still_epsilon --
--               whereas distance from the anchor is not. A parked entity never
--               clears min_dir_seg and so still falls through to keepalive_ms
--   still_epsilon  per-sample displacement below which the entity counts as
--               stopped; coming to a stop pins a vertex at the stopping point
--   min_gap_ms  floor between points for the stop rule, so stutter-stepping
--               cannot spam vertices
--   min_dir_seg travel needed before the corridor direction is trusted (short
--               deltas at high sv_fps are jitter, not heading)
--   dev_epsilon deviation under which a sample still counts as "on the line";
--               the last such sample is the corner candidate

-- Objective carriers move at player speed (g_speed 320, more when sprinting

-- move_gap_ms gives carriers a 10 Hz floor while they are covering ground. The

-- vertices, so a strafe-jumped or circle-strafed approach measures shorter than
-- it was; at 320 u/s a 100 ms floor puts samples 32 units apart, inside tol_xy,
-- and the polyline becomes the path rather than an approximation of it.
-- Deliberately time-based and not per-frame: sample volume must not depend on
-- sv_fps, or the same carry produces 2.5x the events on a 125 fps server as on
-- a 50 fps one with nothing downstream able to tell the two apart. A carrier
-- standing on the spot never clears min_dir_seg, so it still beats at
-- keepalive_ms rather than 10 Hz.
